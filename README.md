We are a local, small business located in beautiful [Hillsboro, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsboro,_Oregon) specialising in creating both practical and decorative works of art with lasers by engraving and cutting in a myriad of materials such as wood, glass, acrylic, and more!

Our mission is to bring joy through personalised creations by using our skills as makers and engineers, while also embracing diversity as a fellow neurodivergent (autistic, transgender) and being a woman-owned business.
